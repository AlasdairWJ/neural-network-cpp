# neural-network-cpp
 Neural Network written in c++ using templates

----

to quote Google's C++ Style Guide:

>Template metaprogramming sometimes allows cleaner and easier-to-use interfaces than would be possible without it, but it's also often a temptation to be overly clever.

huh, wonder who that's intended for. so anyway here's a an entirely templated modular neural network.

So this is a 2.0 version of the code I wrote for my disseration in uni, and my god did it need a rewrite. More notes to come!
